📖 About the Project This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand core Java concepts through practical examples. It includes a variety of code samples organized into thematic folders, covering fundamental programming topics like inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. The project is a personal learning log for Utkarsh Dubey and a resource for anyone looking to explore Java with hands-on coding.

🚀 Features

👉 Organized Structure: Code is divided into folders like basic-programs, inheritance, and multithreading for easy navigation.\
🌱 Beginner-Friendly: Simple, well-commented Java classes to help new programmers learn Java.\
🧠 Core Concepts: Covers essential topics such as OOP, data structures, and exception handling.\
👍 Hands-On Learning: Practical code examples to reinforce theoretical knowledge.\
📦 No Dependencies: Most scripts use only the standard Java libraries.

🛠️ Installation To use the Java files in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iuttkarshh0409/core-java-concepts-utkarsh.git
cd core-java-concepts-utkarsh
```

2. **Install Java:** Ensure you have JDK 11 or higher installed. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

3. **Compile and Run:** No external dependencies required. Use `javac` and `java` to compile and run files.

🔢 Usage Each Java file in the repository is standalone and can be compiled/run directly. For example:

```bash
cd basic-programs
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

Explore the folders to find programs for specific topics:

- 📂 basic-programs/: Simple programs like printing patterns, conditionals, loops.
- 📂 inheritance/: Demonstration of single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
- 📂 polymorphism/: Examples of method overloading and overriding.
- 📂 multithreading/: Creating and managing threads in Java.
- 📂 file-handling/: Reading/writing files using File I/O.
- 📂 constructors/: Use of default and parameterized constructors.
- 📂 data-structures/: Implementation of arrays, lists, and stacks.
- 📂 dynamic-binding/: Code demonstrating late binding and upcasting.
